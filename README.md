# World_Weather_Analysis
## Project Overview
For this analysis, we are tasked with applying a few changes to the app PlanMyTrip. We were asked to:
  1. Add a weather description to the weather data.
  2. Identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels with user input.
  3. Have the beta tester choose four cities to create a travel itinerary.
  4. Use Google Maps Directions API to create a travel route between the four chosen cities as well as a marker layer map.
